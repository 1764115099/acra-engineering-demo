# What is this?

Acra Engineering Demo illustrates the integration of [Acra data protection suite](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra) into your existing application. Protecting the data is completely transparent for the users and requires minimal changes in the infrastructure.

This demo has two examples:

| [Protecting Django app](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo#protecting-data-on-django-based-web-site) | [Protecting CLI python app](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo#protecting-data-of-simple-database-application) |
|---|---|

**Integrating Acra into any application requires 3 steps:**

1. **Generation of encryption keys**. For this example, we will generate one storage keypair (for encryption/decryption of the data) and two transport keypairs (for a secure connection between AcraServer and AcraConnector). 
2. **Integration of AcraWriter** â€“ the client-side library â€“ into the application (web or mobile app). AcraWriter encrypts the data using storage public key. The application then writes the data to the database. The application reads the decrypted data from AcraConnector.
3. **Deploy server-side infrastructure**: AcraConnector and AcraServer.  
      1. AcraConnector ensures transport protection between the client app and AcraServer. AcraConnector is deployed as close as possible to AcraWriter (ideally, at the same host) and uses its own transport keypair and AcraServer's public key to encrypt the transport.
      2. AcraServer receives a reading request from application through AcraConnector, makes sure it's legit, fetches the data from the database, decrypts it, and returns to the AcraConnector. AcraServer is a separate container and is connected to the database and AcraConnector. AcraServer uses the storage's private key to decrypt the data and its own transport keypair and AcraConnector's public key to encrypt transport.

Please refer to the [Acra/Readme documentation](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra#protecting-data-in-sql-databases-using-acrawriter-and-acraserver) for more detailed description and schemes (or you can find the [same entry](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-acra/#protecting-data-using-acra) and all the other current documentation for Acra on the dedicated [Cossack Labs Documentation Server](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/products/acra/)).

# Protecting data on Django-based web site

## 1. Installation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/master/run.sh | \
    bash -s -- django
```

This command downloads the code of Django website example, Acra Docker containers, PostgreSQL database, sets up the environment, and provides a list of links for you to try.

## 2. What's inside

<p align="center"><img src="_pics/eng_demo_django.png" alt="Protecting Django web application: Acra architecture" width="700"></p>

**The client application** is the famous Django app example â€“ the source code of [djangoproject.com](https://www.djangoproject.com/). We've [updated their source code](https://github.com/cossacklabs/djangoproject.com) to protect blog posts. Django app **encrypts** the sensitive fields of blog posts into separate AcraStructs (author name, author email, content are encrypted; blog post ID and title are in plaintext).

Django app writes AcraStructs to the database and **reads the decrypted posts** through AcraConnector and AcraServer (which pretends to be a database).

From the users' perspective, the website works as it used to. However, the blog posts are protected now.

### 2.1 Update etc/hosts

Please add a temporary entry to the hosts file:

```bash
echo "$SERVER_IP www.djangoproject.example" >> /etc/hosts
```

where `SERVER_IP` is the IP address of the server that is running the Acra Engineering Demo (if you run the demo on your machine, set it to `127.0.0.1`). Updating the hosts file is required because we will run the protected djangoproject site locally. You can remove this line when you stop needed to access the demo site.

### 2.2 Add a new post

1. Log into admin cabinet [http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/admin/blog/entry/](http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/admin/blog/entry/) using user/password: `admin/admin`. Add a blog post to the Blogs/Entries:

<img src="_pics/web_django_posts.png" width="600">

2. Open the blog posts' feed [http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/weblog/](http://www.djangoproject.example:8000/weblog/) and see your fresh post.

### 2.3 Connect to the database from the web

Everything worked well! Now, let's check the content of the database.

Log into the web PostgreSQL interface [http://www.djangoproject.example:8008](http://www.djangoproject.example:8008) using user/password: `test`/`test`. Find your blog post in  `schemes > public > Tables > blog_entries`, download and read the content â€“ it's encrypted.

<img src="_pics/db_django.png" width="900">

So, the blog posts are stored encrypted, but it's transparent for site visitors and admins.

### 2.4 Check the monitoring

Open Grafana dashboards to see the performance stats of AcraServer and AcraConnector. We collect following metrics: the number of decrypted AcraStructs, request and response processing time.

Grafana is available at [http://www.djangoproject.example:3000](http://www.djangoproject.example:3000).

<img src="_pics/django_monitoring.png" width="900">

### 2.5 Other available resources

There's more to explore:

1. PostgreSQL â€“ connect directly to the database using the admin account `postgres/test`: [postgresql://www.djangoproject.example:5432](postgresql://www.djangoproject.example:5432).

2. Prometheus â€“  examine the collected metrics: [http://www.djangoproject.example:9090](http://www.djangoproject.example:9090).

3. AcraConnector â€“ send some data directly through AcraConnector: [tcp://www.djangoproject.example:9494](tcp://www.djangoproject.example:9494).

4. AcraWebConfig â€“ configure AcraServer remotely (i.e. disable intrusion detection) using the default account `test/test`: [http://www.djangoproject.example:8001](http://www.djangoproject.example:8001).

5. [Docker-compose.django.yml](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/blob/master/django/docker-compose.django.yml) file â€“ read details about configuration and containers used in this example.  

## 3. Show me the code!

So, was it easy to integrate Acra into Django application? Sure it was!

You can [compare our repo to the original repo](
https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/compare/master...cossacklabs:master) and see how few changes we introduced:

1. We've added Acra storage public key ([L278](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/compare/master...cossacklabs:master#diff-6bcf911294def277f06abfe682ce5d7bR278)) necessary for AcraWriter to encrypt the data:
```
ACRA_SERVER_PUBLIC_KEY = b64decode(SECRETS.get('acra_storage_public_key'))
```

2. We added AcraWriter as a dependency and wrapped the original fields with it:

```python
import acrawriter.django

summary = acrawriter.django.TextField()
summary_html = acrawriter.django.TextField()
body = acrawriter.django.TextField()
body_html = acrawriter.django.TextField()
author = acrawriter.django.CharField(max_length=100)
```

3. We've also [run a database migration](https://github.com/django/djangoproject.com/compare/master...cossacklabs:master#diff-677329e0253d6cbba693e1ae0deda5b6) that changed the fields' format from `string` to `binary` to store the encrypted data.

Those are all the code changes! ðŸŽ‰

# Protecting the data in a simple database application

## 1. Installation

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/master/run.sh | \
    bash -s -- python
```

This command downloads a simple Python application that stores the data in a database, Acra Docker containers, PostgreSQL database, sets up the environment, and provides a list of links for you to try.

## 2. What's inside

<p align="center"><img src="_pics/eng_demo_python.png" alt="Protecting simple python application: Acra architecture" width="560"></p>

**The client application** is a simple [python console application](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/tree/master/examples/python) that works with a database. The application **encrypts** the data in AcraStructs before sending it to a database. The application **reads** the decrypted data through AcraConnector and AcraServer (that are transparent for the application).

### 2.1 Write data

```bash
docker exec -it python_python_1 \
  python /app/example_with_zone.py --data="top secret data"
  
$:
data: top secret data
zone: DDDDDDDDFidFDxORlrleaUrC
```

Call the [`example_with_zone.py`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/blob/master/examples/python/example_with_zone.py) to encrypt the "top secret data" with a specific [Zone](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-acra/#zones). The application generates Zones using AcraServer HTTP API, then it uses Zone public key and Zone Id for encryption.

### 2.2 Read data

Read the data using the same ZoneId. AcraServer decrypts the data and returns plaintext:

```bash
docker exec -it python_python_1 \
  python /app/example_with_zone.py --print --zone_id=DDDDDDDDFidFDxORlrleaUrC

$:
use zone_id:  DDDDDDDDFidFDxORlrleaUrC
id  - zone - data - raw_data
1   - DDDDDDDDFidFDxORlrleaUrC - top secret data - top secret data
```

The output contains Zone Id, the decrypted `data`, and `raw_data` (stored in plaintext for the demo purposes),

### 2.3 Read the data directly from the database

To make sure that the data is stored in an encrypted form, read it directly from the database:

```bash
docker exec -it python_python_1 \
  python /app/example_with_zone.py --print --zone_id=DDDDDDDDFidFDxORlrleaUrC --host=postgresql --port=5432
  
$:
use zone_id:  DDDDDDDDkOGnRsCBZEwXnHlL
id  - zone - data - raw_data
1   - DDDDDDDDkOGnRsCBZEwXnHlL - """"""""UEC2-CVs-K)'9@gJ-0 '&T@ {W|SÒ¡Ï›Ú±Y+:uKn"3WÉ•|Ict'JGCW;@ Ì›W]aPI|Z ~*vI] - top secret data
```

As expected, no entity decrypts the `data`. The `raw_data` is stored as plaintext so nothing changes.

### 2.4 Connect to the database from the web

1. Log into web PostgreSQL interface [http://$HOST:8008](http://127.0.0.1:8008) using user/password: test/test. 
`$HOST` is the IP address of the server where Acra Engineering Demo is running (if you run the demo on your machine, set it to "127.0.0.1").

2. Find the table and the data rows.

<img src="_pics/db_web_python.png" width="700">

3. Tyr reading the content of `data` field â€“ it's encrypted!

So, the data is stored in an encrypted form, but it is transparent for the Python application.

### 2.5 Encrypt the data without Zones

Usage of [Zones](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-acra/#zones) provides compartmentalisation as different users of the same app will have different encryption keys. However, it's possible to [use AcraServer without Zones](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-acra/#running-acraserver-in-zone-mode).

1. To disable Zones in AcraWebConfig, open [http://$HOST:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001) using the default account `test/test` and tap "No" for "zone mode".

<img src="_pics/acra_web_config_python.png" width="800">

2. Write and read the data:

```bash
docker exec -it python_python_1 \
  python /app/example_without_zone.py --data="secret data without zones"
  
$:
insert data: secret data without zones

docker exec -it python_python_1 \
  python /app/example_without_zone.py --print   

$:                        
id  - data                 - raw_data
2   - secret data without zones - secret data without zones
```

> Note: AcraServer decrypts either AcraStructs with Zones or without Zones at the same time. Sending different kinds of AcraStructs without changing the mode will lead to decryption errors.

### 2.5 Other available resources

1. PostgreSQL â€“ connect directly to the database using the admin account `postgres/test`: [postgresql://$HOST:5432](postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432).

2. Prometheus â€“ examine the collected metrics: [http://$HOST:9090](http://127.0.0.1:9090).

3. Grafana â€“ see the dashboards with Acra metrics: [http://$HOST:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

4. AcraConnector â€“ send some data directly through AcraConnector: [tcp://$HOST:9494](tcp://127.0.0.1:9494).

5. AcraWebConfig â€“ configure AcraServer remotely (i.e. disable intrusion detection) using the default account `test/test`: [http://$HOST:8001](http://127.0.0.1:8001).

6. [Docker-compose.python.yml](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra-engineering-demo/blob/master/python/docker-compose.python.yml) file â€“ read details about configuration and containers used in this example.  

 
## 3. Show me the code!

Take a look at the complete code of [`example_with_zone.py`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/blob/master/examples/python/example_with_zone.py) and [`example_without_zone.py`](https://github.com/cossacklabs/acra/blob/master/examples/python/example_without_zone.py).

Let's see how many code lines are necessary to encrypt some data using Acra. We will look at the example with Zones because it's more complicated and requires additional API call to fetch Zone.

1. The app gets a Zone using [AcraServer API](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/pages/documentation-acra/#client-side-with-zones):

```python
def get_zone():
    response = urlopen('{}/getNewZone'.format(ACRA_CONNECTOR_API_ADDRESS))
    json_data = response.read().decode('utf-8')
    zone_data = json.loads(json_data)
    return zone_data['id'], b64decode(zone_data['public_key'])
```

2. The app uses ZoneId and Zone public key to encrypt the data â€“

```python
encrypted_data = create_acrastruct(
  data.encode('utf-8'), key, zone_id.encode('utf-8'))
```

and writes the data to the database as usual:

```python
connection.execute(
    test_table.insert(), data=encrypted_data,
    zone_id=zone_id.encode('utf-8'),
    raw_data=data)
```

3. Nothing changes when reading the data from the database:

```python
result = connection.execute(
    select([cast(zone_id.encode('utf-8'), BYTEA), test_table]))
result = result.fetchall()

ZONE_ID_INDEX = 0
for row in result:
    print(
        "{:<3} - {} - {} - {}\n".format(
        row['id'], row[ZONE_ID_INDEX].decode('utf-8'),
        row['data'].decode('utf-8', errors='ignore'), row['raw_data']))
```

These are all the code changes! ðŸŽ‰
